# Aeotec

This app adds support for Aeotec devices in Homey.

NOTE: 
> - Default device settings are not correctly set when pairing, after pairing change the settings to a different value, then save, change the settings back to the default and save again.
> - LED Bulb only supports turning on and off, and dimming (color control will be added later).
